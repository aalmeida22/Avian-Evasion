# Avian-Evasion
Avian Evasion is a beginner-friendly side-scrolling game where you play as a bird dodging incoming obstacles while flying forward. Developed using Python and Pygame, this game is my final project for an introductory computer technologies course, combining my passion for birds with my interest in game development.
