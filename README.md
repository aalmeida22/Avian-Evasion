# Avian-Evasion
Avian Evasion is a beginner-friendly side-scrolling game where you play as a bird dodging incoming obstacles while flying forward. Developed using Python and Pygame, this game is my final project for an introductory computer technologies course, combining my passion for birds with my interest in game development.

# Project Objectives
- Create a playable Python game using Pygame
- Animate sprites and background elements
- Implement obstacle and power-up mechanics
- Play background music and sound effect
- Provide a simple, intuitive user experience
